I am also planning on doing the following steps:

- Stretching the Search Bar field
- Fixing the text (next to the image) to be in the center
- Making a webpage stretch (or shrink) according to screen/window/device size
- Adding event listener and buiding a drop down menu when clicking on the text of the picture, in order to see more details about the item
- Rewrite the app in TypeScript
